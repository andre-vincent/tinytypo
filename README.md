Tiny Typo
=========

Tiny Typo is a CSS base for web editorial content, ready for use, for readable web pages, on all media.

This microframework makes the typographic minimum necessary for the writing of web documents. Compliant with W3C standards, Tiny Typo is designed for all devices, naturally responsive, without forgetting print, multilingualism and accessibility.

Tiny Typo holds only two files! Easy to use, it complements your usual reset to serve as foundation for your own styles. Made of HTML and CSS, it's simple and robust, very light (no image, no font, no JavaScript). It is customizable via LESS.
